# Taco Parser

An exercise in geolocation and csv parsing. The application parses through information on hundreds of Taco Bell locations. Each location is separated out and given values of its locationâ€™s name and longitude and latitude coordinates.

By using the GeoCoordinatePortable class, the application calculates the distance between all locations on the CSV file and returns the two that are farthest apart.

Test Driven Development using xUnit ensures that missing or invalid data is handled correctly.
